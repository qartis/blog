title: "Eagle library for HLK-RM04 wifi module"
date: 2014-05-20

I've created [an eagle library][1] for the $15 [Hi-Link HLK-RM04][2] wifi
module. All pins are named and numbered. The only thing you need to look out
for is the 2mm pin spacing. Typical protoboard spacing is 2.54mm, so you will
likely need to make a breakout board for this module. I'm preparing a follow-up
post with details on how to init this module and connect to a secured WPA2
network.
