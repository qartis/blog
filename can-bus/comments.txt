Better you should use #define for raw values, Eg #define polynomial c599

Readability would be more....!!

Did you ever get anywhere with this project? I'm a computer science student
with 20 years truck repair experience. I'm taking an SAE seminar on the CAN
data link found in trucks. I'm hoping to write a project at may incorporate any
of this material if it is available, Like wiring schematics ext. I'm not
stealing ideas but rather looking for similar ideas. Thanks
