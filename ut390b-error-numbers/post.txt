title: "UT390B laser distance meter error numbers"

I've gotten a few emails asking for help about the Uni-T UT390B laser distance
meter because the operating manual is written in Chinese. I've created a list
of the unit's error messages in case it's useful for anyone developing with
this device.

```c
enum {
    ERR_BATTERY_LOW = 101,
    ERR_CALCULATION = 104,
    ERR_HIGH_TEMP = 152,
    ERR_LOW_TEMP = 153,
    ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE = 154,
    ERR_WEAK_SIGNAL = 155,
    ERR_STRONG_SIGNAL = 156,
    ERR_BACKGROUND_ILLUM = 157,
    ERR_DEVICE_SHAKING = 160
};
```
