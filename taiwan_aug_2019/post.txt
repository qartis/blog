### Osaka

Had to travel for work for 2 weeks. Booked myself a 7 hour layover in Osaka to
see the city. I had planned to check out an Izayaka stall called 居酒屋とよ
(Izayaka Toyo) that Sarah and I had seen on Netflix. Got there, huge line up,
had some delicious sushi instead.

Japan feels weird for me because I see Chinese characters everywhere so my
brain feels confident when I walk into a shop but I pronounce them in Japanese
so all I can do is point and mime.

Next flight from Osaka to Taipei was delayed, arrived at 1am, subway was
already shut down, had to take a taxi to the hotel.

### 台北

On Sunday I set out to buy a small USB-C (F) to Lightning (M) adapter that
would allow me to charge my iPhone with the Innergie GaN USB-C charger and
USB-C-to-USB-C cable that I had brought to charge my USB-C laptop. I asked
around at Syntrend market and most vendors said they've never heard of such an
adapter but I got lucky with one little stall and managed to find what I was
looking for. I didn't have my charger with me so I planned to test it later
that night. Later on Sunday night my coworkers and I got Indian food and went
to the 通化夜市 nightmarket. Of course when I got back home the adapter didn't
work at all. Hmm.

Monday and Tuesday were regular workdays. I got a local coworker to help me buy
a new adapter on 蝦皮 (<http://shopee.tw>). It arrived the next day and I found
that it worked on my Innergie USB-C charger, but it didn't work on a coworker's
HP USB-C charger, and it didn't work when I tried to charge my iPhone via the
USB-C port on my laptop. Looks like I'll need to carry a separate cable for
charging my phone until I can find a well-behaved Lightning adapter.

On Wednesday there was a lot of talk about typhoon Lekima that was getting
stronger and was projected to make landfall on Friday morning. We had some
great meals during the week: 牛肉麵, 魯肉飯 with 滷蛋, 炸雞, 珍珠包子, 蔥油餅,
紅油抄手, lots of 波霸奶茶 and some great Thai food.

Wednesday night I had to stay up late to talk to some coworkers in California.
At 5:30am I got woken up by the earthquake and even though I only had about 2
hours of sleep I immediately realized it was an earthquake and all I could
think was "god damn earthquake, stop shaking, I need to sleep". Within a minute
or two my phone received a government notification about the earthquake (wow).
Thursday night we stayed late at the factory and as rumors grew that the
government was going to declare a typhoon day and give most workers the day
off, we all huddled around our laptops listening to the howling rain and
thunder outside and hoping that our district would be added to the list. At 8pm
we got the good news and we decided to go work from our office in Taipei 101 on
Friday and see the typhoon from up high.

The next morning we let ourselves sleep in a bit and then ate the lunch buffet
at the Grand Hyatt. Wow! Unlimited sashimi, and good stuff too. I wanted to be
polite so I asked the chef cutting the sashimi "有限制吗"? He seemed to not
understand my question. "刺身是无限吗? 有限嗎？" The guy beside me asked if I
needed help. Am I pronouncing it wrong or something? "限量? 限制？ 有限制嗎？"
Finally the chef said no, there's no limit, get as much as you want. I think he
was trying to imply that my question was silly. Ok buddy, we'll see who's
silly.

I ordered an initial plate of 10 pieces of salmon sashimi, then went back for
another plate of 20. A coworker said he didn't believe I could eat all 20
pieces after all the other buffet food I had already eaten. What's going on
here? I'm from Vancouver, I've got a separate sashimi stomach. I wanted until
there was nobody in the sushi line and I went up and asked for 20 more pieces.
The same sushi chef looked me in the eye and said "20片夠嗎?" Ha, ha. Ok, give
me 40 pieces.

I felt pretty sick by the end. The sushi chef had won and he didn't even know
it (or maybe he did?). I brutalized the office toilet for the rest of the day.

### 花蓮

I had seen an ad for the 2019 首屆網紅直播大展 that was happening at the
convention center beside my hotel. I decided to go check it out since Kevin has
been suggesting that I try live-streaming my motorcycle adventures and they
might have some nice helmet-mounted cameras or IRL livestreaming backpacks or
something. It was mostly beauty products and stuff for livestreamers and
influencers to promote on their streams, and a couple of Taiwanese celebrity
influencers interacting with fans on a big stage. No hardware, no cameras. 

A coworker and I took the train to Hualien. We rented motorcycles at the same
shop that I had rented from last time because I knew they didn't require an
international driver's licence. That night we went to the 東大門 nightmarket
and got some snacks, played an archery game and won some little spinner things,
and then took our food and our toys to the top of a hill and competed to see
who could shoot them the highest.

Later that night we got some more 魯肉飯 from a little stall. The next morning
we rode our scooters north up the coastline towards 大清水. We saw a big orange
wasp-looking thing and I thought it might be an executioner wasp so I wanted to
snap a photo to look it up later. We chased it around for a while, never got a
clear photo of it, and later we looked it up and executioner wasps only live in
central and south america.

We got stuck in a rainstorm on the way back towards Hualien and took shelter in
a 7-Eleven. Once the rain stopped we rode toward the beach and stumbled upon a
Taiwan indigenous peoples festival called 太魯閣達吉利生活節 in 秀林鄉.
