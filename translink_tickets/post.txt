title: 'Translink magnetic ticket format'

Translink, the public transit provider for Vancouver, BC, will soon be
switching to a stored-value RFID card (the Compass Card), so I figure there's
no harm in publishing this now. In short, it's trivial to create Translink
tickets which expire many years in the future and can be used to ride the bus
system free of charge.

A PDF copy of the report is available at http://qartis.com/translink.pdf.

Some of the code is available at http://github.com/qartis/translink/.
