Hi, Any furthur info on Laser Range Finder ?

Regards  
Mike

#### qartis
What kind of info do you need?

#### drjohn
Any progress on sending it commands?

Any idea of how fast you can pulse the 'on' line and get reliable results?

#### speleomaniac
some experimenting showed that:

sending char 'r' powers down the system, all other characters except * and # are echoed back.

the device seems to accept commands in form: `*xxxxx#`

where x are numbers. the last number defines the action: i think it accepts only numbers with 5 digits.

`*43531#` outputs:
```
*00021012#pMsgWrite TRUE
pInitDataWrite TRUE
```

`*11112#` turns on laser and does 3 readings, but display shows "Er":
```
Dist: 428,curtemp =18
V2.0
nDist: 428,tempDv=0
Dist: 428,curtemp =18
V2.0
nDist: 428,tempDv=0
Dist: 428,curtemp =18

nDist: 428,tempDv=0

u32temp =0
*000720150000000042#
```

`*54343#` does nothing

`*11114#` does a single reading, and displays on lcd. BINGO:
```
Dist: 525,curtemp =18
V2.0
nDist: 525,tempDv=0
```

`*55555#` dumps some data:
```
772*0024500001000022430000000000000000000000000000000040#*0024500002000009340000000000000000000000000000000019#*0024500003000007830000000000000000000000000000000067#*0024500004000009530000000000000000000000000000000040#*0024500005000002980000000000000000000000000000000079#

#### Aslak
Hi! How often can this setup read out data? once per sec?

#### Nikolai
This information would interest me also because i can find no information about it.

Andrew,

I managed to combine some of the things discussed here so I can now turn it on
(NPN), take a reading (serial), shut it off (serial), and capture all of the
output (serial).The problem I am having it that it is challenging to parse the
output (just providing mm). I tried using your method but it doesn't work for
me. Is there a simple way that I can search the stream for ": " (colon &
space)? or something like that? - The value follows those two characters. - The
serial command also comes back with a response that is a bunch of leading zeros
and the distance value that I am looking for. So, either of these are fine but
it seems like it should be simple to do and yet I am having a very very hard
time doing so.

Any thoughts?


```
....
void loop(void)
{
thisUpdate = millis();

if (thisUpdate >= (lastUpdate + interval)){
// Turn the device on using an NPN transistor
subRecord(); // call the routine to take a reading
}

// Serial.print("I should turn off now");
if (thisUpdate >= (lastUpdate + interval+TimeToTakeReading)){
subOff(); // turn it off
lastUpdate = thisUpdate;
}

//This is how I am reading the data continuously
if(Serial1.available()){
char inByte = Serial1.read();
Serial.write(inByte);
}
}

////////////Sampling the Serial line for a value
void subRecord(){
Serial1.write("*11114#"); //*11114# does a single reading, and displays on lcd. BINGO:
Complete = true;
}
/////////////Turning off
void subOff(){
Serial1.write("r");
Complete = false;
}
```

Results are

#### qartis
See my updated post here:
<http://blog.qartis.com/laser-distance-meter-update-serial-commands-timing-measurements/>

Short answer: about 1 measurement per second for single-shot mode, and about 3
measurements per second for rapid-fire mode.

#### Tom
Hi,  
Could you tell me how could you turn it on?

Thanks in advance!

Tom

#### JCT250
Did you find a datasheet or something with these commands or was it trial and
error? Just wondering if it was trial and error how many of the different
combinations you tried?

#### speleomaniac
Trial and error. After finding out chars * and # are not echoed back, it took
me about 15 tries to figure out the pattern. In short, it was pure luck ðŸ™‚

#### JCT250
Ok sweet, Did you just pick random combinations withing the chars * and # or
did you run through a list of them?

Just wondering whether its worth me having a hack at some code that scrolls
through all the *xxxxx# combinations to see if there are any other ones

hello  
From : <http://y6-multicopter.blogspot.ru/2014/03/blog-post.html>  
the shown code is working in rapid fire, but i whant a one second interval shot

t = millis();
}

litera = litera-48;// convert ASCII to figure ...
buf[rc] = litera; // And add it to the array.
rc++;
}
}
}else{

countdata++;

#### Mohamed Elsayed
hello andrew i want to ask about how did u discover all these info about that
module coz i have GLM50 bosh and i want to connect it with my MCU and i don't
know from where i can start .

#### Aikidokajeff
Hi, I know it's been a while, but did you ever work out what command would
change the "base" measurement distance from base of unit to top of unit etc?

Thanks,

#### speleomaniac
sorry, i haven't encountered such command.

but you can add or subtract the size of the lasermeter from the measured value
ðŸ™‚

#### Aikidokajeff
No problem.  
That was my plan.

I've still not found the combination either.

Has anyone else noticed the unit appears to be out by about 2cm - it is
consistent though, so again I can subtract it from the equation.

#### Bob Bowie
Andrew,

I have a remote controlled lawnmower that I would like to convert to a robotic
mower. You can view my mower at:

<http://www.instructables.com/member/Bob+Bowie/>

I am familiar with BASIC programming and have purchased a Basic Stamp.

By programming the Basic Stamp, I can control the wheel chair motors (i.e.,
forward, reverse, and time in motion).

As the mower moves, I need to know its position (x,y coordinates).

I see that you have an article, "Parsing laser distance meter serial output". I
am hoping that you might be able to show me how to parse the laser meter using
the Basic Stamp.

Here's a link to the Basic Stamp:
